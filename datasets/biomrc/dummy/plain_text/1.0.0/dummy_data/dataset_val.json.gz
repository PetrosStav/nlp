{"abstracts": ["BACKGROUND: There is abundance of epidemiological studies of @entity10 in developed and western countries; however, data in developing countries and in Egypt are still lacking. This study aims to detect the prevalence of @entity12967 in both urban and rural sectors in Fayoum governorate, Egypt. METHODS: A total of 2600 subjects were included using multi-stage stratified systematic random sampling, with respondent rate of 91.3  %. A pre-designed Arabic version, interviewer-administered, pilot tested structured questionnaire was developed according to The International Classification of @entity2794 , 3rd edition (beta version), and this questionnaire was validated and the strength of agreement in @entity10 diagnosis was good. RESULTS: The 1-year @entity10 prevalence was 51.4  %, which was more prevalent in urban dwellers. The most common primary @entity10 type was episodic tension @entity10 (prevalence; 24.5  %), followed by @entity2704 (prevalence; 17.3  %), both types peaked in midlife. @entity2794 were more common in females with exception of @entity2686 that showed the expected male dominance. The risk of @entity2794 increased more than one fold and half when the @entity1 were females, married, and in those with high education. More than 60  % of our @entity1 did not seek medical advice for their headaches problem; this percentage was higher in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: @entity12967 are common in Egypt; prevalence rate was comparable with western countries with exception of episodic tension @entity10 . Still @entity10 is under-estimated and under-recognized in Egypt and this problem should be targeted by health care providers.\n", "BACKGROUND: This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review on parasympathomimetic drugs for the treatment of @entity3359 due to radiotherapy (published in Issue 3, 2007). @entity3359 is a predictable side effect of radiotherapy to the head and neck region. @entity2134 (a @entity12334 ) is licensed in many countries for the treatment of radiation-induced @entity3359 . Other parasympathomimetics have also been used 'off licence' in the treatment of this condition. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of parasympathomimetic drugs in the treatment of radiation-induced @entity3359 (specifically radiation-induced @entity2133 ). SEARCH METHODS: For this update, we ran searches of the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL in July 2015. We checked the reference lists of retrieved articles for additional studies, contacted experts in the field for unpublished and ongoing trials, and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies for unpublished and ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria for the review were: 1) randomised controlled trials; 2) @entity1 suffering from radiation-induced @entity3359 ; 3) @entity1 treated with parasympathomimetic drugs; and 4) assessable data available on primary outcome measure. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The two review authors independently collected data from the full-text version of relevant papers including: 1) citation details; 2) @entity1 ; 3) interventions; 4) assessments; 5) outcomes (that is efficacy, tolerability); and 6) quality issues.Due to a lack of appropriate data, we were unable to perform a meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: In the original review, three studies, including a total of 298 @entity1 , fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All three studies involved the use of @entity2134 . We have included no additional studies in the update of the review; we have excluded eight additional studies.The data suggest that @entity2134 is more effective than placebo and at least as effective as artificial saliva. The response rate was 42% to 51%. The time to response was up to 12 weeks. The overall side effect rate was high, and side effects were the main reason for withdrawal (6% to 15% of @entity1 taking 5 mg three times a day had to withdraw). The side effects were usually the result of generalised parasympathomimetic stimulation (for example sweating, @entity10 , urinary frequency, vasodilatation). Response rates were not dose dependent, but side effect rates were dose dependent. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence to support the use of @entity2134 in the treatment of radiation-induced @entity2133 . Currently, there is little evidence to support the use of other parasympathomimetic drugs in the treatment of radiation-induced @entity2133 . Available studies suggest that approximately half of @entity1 will respond, but side effects can be problematic. The conclusions of the update are the same as the conclusions of the original review, since no new relevant studies have been published in the interim.\n", "OBJECTIVES: No prospectively derived or validated decision tools identify @entity341 ( @entity341 ) @entity1 with @entity712 ( @entity712 ) at low risk for 30-day adverse events who are thus potential candidates for safe @entity341 discharge. This study sought to accomplish that goal. BACKGROUND: The nearly 1 million annual @entity341 visits for @entity712 are associated with high proportions of admissions and consume significant resources. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 1,033 @entity1 diagnosed with @entity712 in the @entity341 from 4 hospitals between July 20, 2007, and February 4, 2011. We used an ordinal outcome hierarchy, defined as the incidence of the most severe adverse event within 30 days of @entity341 evaluation ( @entity1187 , coronary revascularization, emergent dialysis, intubation, mechanical cardiac support, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and @entity204 ). RESULTS: Of 1,033 @entity1 enrolled, 126 (12%) experienced at least one 30-day adverse event. The decision tool had a C statistic of 0.68 (95% confidence interval: 0.63 to 0.74). Elevated troponin (p  < 0.001) and renal function (p  = 0.01) were significant predictors of adverse events in our multivariable model, whereas B-type natriuretic peptide (p  = 0.09), @entity7405 (p  = 0.09), and @entity1 undergoing dialysis (p  = 0.07) trended toward significance. At risk thresholds of 1%, 3%, and 5%, we found 0%, 1.4%, and 13.0% @entity1 were at low risk, with negative predictive values of 100%, 96%, and 93%, respectively.

However, due to the high methodological demands and the primarily unreliable results, this method is rarely used in Germany. The aim of this study was to establish the reliability and morbidity of this method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The frequency of lymph node recurrent disease and complications were prospectively recorded in @entity1 with initially nonpalpable inguinal lymph nodes and histologically negative sentinel lymph nodes. Quality criteria were the false negative rate (percentage of lymph node recurrence in negative procedures) and the morbidity rate. Inguinal regions with palpable lymph nodes and/or evidence of @entity3 were not considered. RESULTS: The study included 37 @entity1 with histologically negative sentinel lymph nodes in 63 groins with nonpalpable inguinal lymph nodes. There were 21  T1(a/b) stages, 10 T2, and 6 T3 stages. @entity5 differentiation was good in 4, moderate in 26, and poor in 7 @entity1 . During a median follow-up of 52 months (range 1-131  months), we observed a bilateral lymph node recurrence in 1  @entity1 and a conservatively managed prolonged lymphorrhea in another @entity1 . Per inguinal region the false-negative rate was 3.2   % and the morbidity rate was 1.6   %; seen per @entity1 the rates were both 2.7   %. CONCLUSIONS: DSNB is a reliable method of lymph node staging in @entity1 with @entity17539 and nonpalpable inguinal lymph nodes. The high degree of reliability in combination with the low morbidity justifies the higher methodical complexity of this method.\n", "We share our experience of 2000 @entity3083 ( @entity378 ) cases, including both typical and atypical presentations. The aim of the study is to estimate the incidence and types of spinal @entity378 referred to our department for diagnosis. 2000 @entity1 were selected by convenience sampling from January 2006 to September 2010. Study design was descriptive and among 2000 mostly unknown cases without evidence of symptoms of systemic @entity378 (1080 males and 920 females). MRI without and with IV contrast, CECT with MPR, and in some cases not fit for MRI, CT myelography, were performed. Out of 2000 cases of tuberculous spine, 1080 (54%) were male and 920 (46%) were female. Their age ranged from 8-60 years. About 90% of @entity1 were below the age of 40 years. Peak age among the males and females was 20-29 years and 14-35 years, respectively. The most common site of involvement was dorsal spine (45%) followed by lumbo-sacral spine (33%), cervical spine (10%) and at multiple levels (12%). Biopsies were done in 240 (12%) cases. Spinal @entity378 should always be suspected when radiographs demonstrate a destructive spinal process. Awareness and prompt management of @entity378 spine will help in reducing the continuing morbidity of this disease.\n", "INTRODUCTION: There is a clinical need for developing systemic transplantation protocols for use of @entity1 skeletal stem cells (also known bone marrow stromal stem cells) (hBMSC) in tissue regeneration. In systemic transplantation studies, only a limited number of hBMSC home to injured tissues suggesting that only a subpopulation of hBMSC possesses \"homing\" capacity. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that a subpopulation of hBMSC defined by ability to form heterotopic bone in vivo, is capable of homing to injured bone. METHODS: We tested ex vivo and in vivo homing capacity of a number of clonal cell populations derived from telomerized hBMSC ( @entity2215 ) with variable ability to form heterotopic bone when implanted subcutaneously in immune deficient @entity19 . In vitro transwell migration assay was used and the in vivo homing ability of transplanted hBMSC to @entity174 in @entity19 was visualized by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). In order to identify the molecular phenotype associated with enhanced migration, we carried out comparative DNA microarray analysis of gene expression of hBMSC-derived high bone forming (HBF) clones versus low bone forming (LBF) clones. RESULTS: HBF clones were exhibited higher ex vivo transwell migration and following intravenous injection, better in vivo homing ability to bone @entity174 when compared to LBF clones. Comparative microarray analysis of HBF versus LBF clones identified enrichment of gene categories of chemo-attraction, adhesion and migration associated genes. Among these, @entity3820 ( @entity3820 ) a and b were highly expressed in HBF clones. Follow up studies showed that the chemoattractant effects of PDGF in vitro was more enhanced in HBF compared to LBF clones and this effect was reduced in presence of a @entity3820 -specific inhibitor: SU-16  f. Also, PDGF exerted greater chemoattractant effect on @entity3820 (+) cells sorted from LBF clones compared to @entity3820 (-) cells. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate phenotypic and molecular association between in vivo bone forming ability and migratory capacity of hBMSC. @entity3820 can be used as a potential marker for the prospective selection of hBMSC populations with high migration and bone formation capacities suitable for clinical trials for enhancing bone regeneration.\n", "BACKGROUND: Rocky Mountain spotted @entity221 is a life-threatening, @entity7545 caused by @entity16736 . This disease is rarely reported in Arizona, and the principal vectors, Dermacentor species ticks, are uncommon in the state. From 2002 through 2004, a focus of Rocky Mountain spotted @entity221 was @entity19331 . METHODS: We obtained blood and tissue specimens from @entity1 with suspected Rocky Mountain spotted @entity221 and ticks from @entity1 ' homesites. Serologic, molecular, immunohistochemical, and culture assays were performed to identify the causative agent. On the basis of specific laboratory criteria, @entity1 were classified as having confirmed or probable @entity15798 . RESULTS: A total of 16 @entity1 with @entity15798 (11 with confirmed and 5 with probable @entity281 ) were identified. Of these @entity1 , 13 (81 percent) were @entity1 12 years of age or younger, 15 (94 percent) were hospitalized, and 2 (12 percent) died. Dense populations of @entity278 ticks were found on @entity235 and in the yards of @entity1 ' homesites. All @entity1 with confirmed Rocky Mountain spotted @entity221 had contact with tick-infested @entity235 , and four had a reported history of tick bite preceding the illness. @entity16736 DNA was detected in nonengorged @entity278 ticks collected at one home, and @entity16736 isolates were cultured from these ticks. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation documents the presence of Rocky Mountain spotted @entity221 , with common @entity278 ( @entity278 ) implicated as a vector of @entity16736 . The broad distribution of this common tick raises concern about its potential to transmit @entity16736 in other settings.\n", "BACKGROUND: The presence of postoperative @entity1157 is the major outcome measure for the assessment of operative success in partial cystectomy for @entity409 . However, the optimal operative strategy to reduce the postoperative @entity1157 rate is yet to be defined. METHODS: Medical records of @entity1 who underwent partial cystectomy for @entity409 between January 2013 and January 2015 were reviewed in this retrospective analysis. All @entity1 were managed with a specific operative protocol. The primary outcome measure was the rate of persistent postoperative @entity1157 . The secondary outcome measures were the morbidity and mortality rate, and the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Twenty-eight @entity1 were included in the study. Only one @entity1 (3.6  %) developed persistent postoperative @entity1157 . The overall morbidity and mortality rate was 17.8 and 0  %, respectively. The median length of hospital stay was 5  days. CONCLUSION: Aggressive preventative surgical measures have led to low persistent @entity1157 rates with low morbidity and mortality.\n", "@entity5139 (OP) and @entity2961 (CM) pesticides are widely used in agriculture. These pesticides are highly toxic to @entity1 and their residues in food pose potential threat to @entity1 health. In this comparative study, we investigated the effect of subchronic exposure of OPs ( @entity2959 , MAL) and CM ( @entity17075 , CB) on @entity35 liver and spleen. Biochemical analysis showed that levels of hepatic enzymes (ALT, @entity6032 , LDH and PAL) changed after exposure to the pesticides. In the liver extracts, lipid peroxidation index increased after the treatment by pesticides. Our results indicated that exposure to MAL and CB leads to alteration of liver redox status. Both pesticides induced focal @entity32 and @entity82 in the liver. After subchronic administration of @entity7671 (200   mg/kg) and CB (25   mg/kg), systemic @entity32 , as depicted by the increase in IFN-   activity in liver, was observed in both @entity2959 and @entity17075 treated animals. In addition, the results showed that MAL significantly increased TCD4+ and TCD8+ lymphocyte number. It also decreased @entity68033 production. However, CB induced a reduction of TCD8+ number and cytokine production in spleen cells. In conclusion, @entity2959 and @entity17075 had significant immunomodulatory properties in the spleen with @entity32 and oxidative stress induction in the liver.\n"], "titles": ["Prevalence of XXXX in
