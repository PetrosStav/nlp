{"abstracts": ["BACKGROUND: Secondary lesion (SL) is an early @entity204 following @entity1566 ( @entity1566 ). @entity842 (NO) could be involved in its pathogenesis. NO is a gaseous metabolite produced by 2 constitutive isoforms of NO synthase ( @entity2824 ), constantly active, and by 1 inducible isoform (iNOS), synthesized during @entity32 and able to produce large amount of NO. High concentrated NO is toxic for cells; therefore, NO concentration is strictly and finely regulated. We suppose that major inhibitory effect on the iNOS expression is represented by the same physiological concentration of NO, synthesized by @entity2824 . The aim of this study is to assess the role of the 2 @entity2824 in pathogenesis of SL after @entity1566 in @entity35 . METHODS: A dorsal @entity1566 has been performed on @entity35 (n=5) by a vascular clip (50 g/mm(2) for 15\"). Fifteen minutes after @entity130 , activity of nNOS and eNOS has been measured (U/mg) in the cervical, dorsal and lumbar segments of spinal cord. Uninjured @entity35 (n=5) served as control group. m-RNA for iNOS in untreated @entity35 (n=2) has been also investigated by Northern blotting. RESULTS: In injured @entity35 nNOS activity has shown a reduction in dorsal and lumbar segments, compared to the control group. eNOS activity, highly variable in the control group, has not been detectable in injured spinal cord. @entity1506 mRNA has not been found in spinal cord of uninjured @entity35 . CONCLUSIONS: These results would be in line with our hypothesis and provide the bases for other investigations. New therapeutic strategies for SL prevention, based on the modulation of @entity2824 , will be evaluated.\n", "BACKGROUND: Different lifestyle choices are commonly regarded as a reflection of socioeconomic status, and the latter is inversely correlated with the risk of developing @entity5 . However, the details of this association are still unclear in terms of the degree to which lifestyle factors are having impact. To explain the correlation between socioeconomic status and @entity5 , we therefore examined the roles played by different lifestyle factors. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of diet and @entity5 was initiated in Japan during 1988. Data were collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire. A follow-up survey was conducted annually, and the cause of @entity204 was recorded from the @entity204 certificate. The total of 127,477 study @entity1 resided in 45 areas of Japan, and we retrieved data for 18,746 @entity1 and 26,184 @entity1 for the present analysis. After 328,030 @entity1 -years of follow-up, 379 deaths from @entity5 were detected: 261 in @entity1 and 118 in @entity1 . RESULTS: For @entity1 , the age-adjusted relative risk was lowest in the highly educated group (relative risk = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.50-1.04). Relative risk after adjustment for age and dietary choices (including pickles, vegetables, fruit, green tea, and preference for salty foods) was the same as the age-adjusted relative risk (relative risk = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.50-1.04). CONCLUSION: The expected inverse correlation between education level and @entity204 from @entity5 was observed in @entity1 . However, this association could not be explained by differences in dietary habits, smoking, or @entity167 consumption associated with socioeconomic status.\n", "Neck lymph node status is the most important factor for prognosis in @entity213 . Sentinel node detection reliably predicts the lymph node status in @entity320 and @entity0 @entity1 . This study evaluates the predictive value of sentinel node detection in 50 @entity1 suffering from @entity189 with a N0 neck as assessed by ultrasound imaging. Following @entity1136 nanocolloid injection in the perimeter of the @entity5 intraoperative sentinel node detection was performed during lymph node dissection. Postoperatively the histological results of the sentinel nodes were compared with the excised neck dissection specimen. Identification of sentinel nodes was successful in all 50 @entity1 with a sensitivity of 89%. In eight cases the sentinel node showed @entity66 ( @entity3121 ). In 41 @entity1 the sentinel node was @entity5 negative reflecting the correct neck lymph node status (pN0). We observed one false-negative result. In this case the sentinel node was free of @entity5 , whereas a neighbouring lymph node contained a lymph node @entity3 ( @entity3121 ). Although we have shown, that skipping of nodal basins can occur, this technique still reliably identifies the sentinel nodes of @entity1 with @entity957 of the pharynx and larynx. Future studies must show, if sentinel node detection is suitable to limit the extent of lymph node dissection in clinically N0 necks of @entity1 suffering from pharyngeal and @entity957 .\n", "A sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was started up and operated with alternating anaerobic/oxic (An/O) to perform enhanced biological @entity3151 removal (EBPR) under the condition of 13-16 degrees C. The results showed that under the condition of low temperature, the EBPR system was successfully started up in a short time (<6 d). The reactor achieved a high and stable @entity3151 removal performance with an influent @entity4613 concentration of 20 mg x L(-1) and the dissolved @entity26 (DO) concentration of 2 mg x L(-1). The effluent @entity4613 concentration was lower than 0.5 mg x L(-1). It was found that decreasing DO had an influence on the steady operation of EBPR system. As DO concentration of aerobic phase decreased from 2 mg x L(-1) to 1 mg x L(-1), the system could still perform EBPR and the @entity3151 removal efficiency was greater than 97.4%. However, the amount of @entity4613 released during anaerobic phase was observed to decrease slightly compared with that of 2 mg x L(-1) @entity121 . Moreover, the @entity3151 removal performance of the system deteriorated immediately and the effluent @entity4613 concentration couldn't meet the national integrated wastewater discharge standard when DO concentration was further lowered to 0.5 mg x L(-1). The experiments of increasing DO to recover @entity3151 removal performance of the EBPR suggested the process failure resulted from low DO was not reversible in the short-term. It was also found that the batch tests of anoxic @entity3151 uptake using @entity3542 and @entity1507 as electron acceptors had an impact on the stable operation of EBPR system, whereas the resulting negative influence could be recovered within 6 cycles. In addition, the mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS) of the EBPR system remained stable and the sludge volume index (SVI) decreased to a certain extend in a long run, implying long-term low temperature and low @entity121 favored the sludge sedimentation.\n", "This study was conducted in order to investigate the advantages and limitations of four analgesic modalities: a) epidural @entity1286 ; b) intravenous @entity1286 ; c) @entity1 controlled intravenous @entity1286 ( @entity1 -controlled analgesia); and d) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Eighty @entity1 undergoing major abdominal surgical procedures were prospectively and randomly treated with one of the above-mentioned analgesic methods. Evaluation of @entity158 perception was done using the visual analogue @entity158 score and the simple descriptive scale 4 hours after the procedure, in the early morning on postoperative day 1 and in the afternoon on postoperative days 1, 2 and 3. The need for @entity532 , if any, were also evaluated for each @entity1 . @entity1 -controlled intravenous @entity1286 yielded the best analgesic effect over the entire period. Epidural @entity1286 was more effective in the very early postoperative period compared to modalities (b) and (d). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, on the other hand, were more effective on the later postoperative days. None of the @entity1 in group C needed supplementary analgesia, as against 20% in group A, 55% in group B and 40% in group D. @entity1 with @entity16251 scores > 70 or @entity308 scores > 70 required supplementation of analgesia more often. @entity1286 proved to be the drug of choice. Drug titration may be modulated in relation to the psychological characteristics of the @entity1 . The best drug titration modality, in fact, is @entity1 -controlled analgesia.\n", "NSAIDs are reported to increase the risk of @entity548 in @entity1524 users. The mechanism underlying this risk is inhibition of @entity1423 , however a pharmacokinetic mechanism resulting in an increased International Normalised Ratio (INR) was proposed in some case reports in @entity1229 treated @entity1 . In this retrospective cohort study the influence of @entity3522 , @entity1623 and @entity5018 on the INR of outpatients stabilised on @entity11271 therapy was investigated. We also determined the role of @entity5060 ( @entity5060 ) polymorphism on @entity1524 dosage and INR in NSAID users. The study was carried out at the Groningen Outpatient @entity715 Service. A retrospective cohort study among @entity1 who received both @entity11271 and one of the NSAIDs under study was performed. @entity1 whose INR rose above the upper level of the therapeutic range (INR above 3.5 or 4.0) after an NSAID under study was added to the @entity11271 therapy, were compared with @entity1 who did not show such an elevation. A two-sample t-test (average @entity11271 dosage, age), and chi-square tests (sex, therapeutic range, type of NSAID) were used to test for differences.
