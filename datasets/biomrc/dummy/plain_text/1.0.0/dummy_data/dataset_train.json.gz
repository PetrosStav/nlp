{"abstracts": ["BACKGROUND: Most brain metastases arise from @entity0 . Few studies compare the brain regions they involve, their numbers and intrinsic attributes. METHODS: Records of all @entity1 referred to Radiation Oncology for treatment of symptomatic brain metastases were obtained. Computed tomography (n = 56) or magnetic resonance imaging (n = 72) brain scans were reviewed. RESULTS: Data from 68 breast and 62 @entity2 @entity1 were compared. Brain metastases presented earlier in the course of the lung than of the @entity0 @entity1 (p = 0.001). There were more metastases in the cerebral hemispheres of the breast than of the @entity2 @entity1 (p = 0.014). More @entity0 @entity1 had cerebellar metastases (p = 0.001). The number of cerebral hemisphere metastases and presence of cerebellar metastases were positively correlated (p = 0.001). The prevalence of at least one @entity3 surrounded with >2 cm of @entity4 was greater for the lung than for the breast @entity1 (p = 0.019). The @entity5 type, rather than the scanning method, correlated with differences between these variables. CONCLUSIONS: Brain metastases from lung occur earlier, are more @entity4 , but fewer in number than those from @entity0 . Cerebellar brain metastases are more frequent in @entity0 .\n", "PURPOSE: Avastin (bevacizumab) intravitreal injections are widely used for treatment of @entity6 .

Entrapped peripheral nerves typically have an increase in cross-sectional area. The purpose of this study was to measure the cross-sectional area and circumference of symptomatic and asymptomatic greater occipital nerves in @entity1 with @entity9 and to correlate the greater occipital nerve cross-sectional area with @entity10 severity, sex, and body mass index. METHODS: Both symptomatic and contralateral asymptomatic greater occipital nerve cross-sectional areas and circumferences were measured by a single examiner using sonography in 17 @entity1 . The Wilcoxon signed rank test and Spearman rank order correlation coefficient were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Significant differences between the cross-sectional areas and circumferences of the symptomatic and asymptomatic greater occipital nerves were noted (P < .001). No difference existed in cross-sectional area (P = .40) or circumference (P = .10) measurements of the nerves between male and female @entity1 . A significant correlation existed between the body mass index and symptomatic (r = 0.424; P = .045) and asymptomatic (r = 0.443; P = .037) cross-sectional areas. There was no correlation shown between the cross-sectional area of the symptomatic nerve and the severity of @entity10 Impact Test 6 scores (r = -0.342; P = .179). CONCLUSIONS: We report sonographic evidence showing an increased cross-sectional area and circumference of the symptomatic greater occipital nerve in @entity1 with @entity9 .\n", "Despite advancements in research made over the past decades, the prognosis of @entity11 remains dismal.

It is not known, however, whether commonly used measures assess elements of physical ability necessary for successful screening. The objective of this exploratory study was to determine whether @entity1 who reported limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental ADLs (IADLs) are perceived by their primary care clinicians to have physical limitations that may impede @entity5 screening. METHODS: @entity1 at 2 rural primary care clinics were surveyed about ADLs and IADLs and about their up-to-date status for breast, cervical, and/or @entity14 screening. Clinicians and office staff were asked whether they believed each @entity1 had a physical limitation that might impede screening. The agreement between @entity1 and clinician assessments was evaluated. RESULTS: Clinicians believed that 43% of @entity1 with severe disability (ADLs) and 30% of @entity1 with moderate disability (IADLs) had limitations that might affect screening. Agreement between @entity1 and clinician assessments was low according to the kappa statistic (k = 0.355), but had a high percentage of negative agreement (92.3%) and a low percentage of positive agreement (42.7%). @entity1 with ADL/IADL-related disability were less likely than nondisabled @entity1 to be current for cervical and @entity0 screening. @entity1 who were viewed by clinicians as having limitations relevant for screening were less likely to be current for cervical @entity5 screening. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a common measure of general disability may not capture all factors relevant for @entity5 screening. An instrument designed to include these factors may help identify and accommodate @entity1 who have disabilities that may impede screening.\n", "The majority of @entity15 fail to remyelinate after chronic demyelinating episodes resulting in @entity16 . In the current study, chronic @entity17 was investigated by using the @entity18 model, a toxic @entity17 model. C57BL/6 @entity19 were administered a 0.2% @entity18 diet up to 16 weeks to induce chronic @entity17 . For comparison, another group was maintained only for 6 weeks on @entity18 to model acute @entity17 . Both groups were analysed regarding the remyelination process after withdrawal of the toxin. Reexpression of myelin proteins after chronic @entity17 was reduced by a factor of two as judged by LFB and myelin protein stainings compared to acute @entity17 after 2 weeks on remyelination. During chronic @entity17 mature oligodendrocytes ( @entity20 positive cells) were severely depleted by 90% compared to age matched controls. Nevertheless, extensive remyelination occurred after withdrawal of @entity18 and was nearly complete after 12 weeks. There was only minimal @entity21 as judged by APP staining, with the course of APP positive axons correlating with macrophage/microglia accumulation. Chronic @entity21 detected by SMI-32 positive staining was only seen after chronic @entity17 and was still observable during the whole remyelination period. These data suggest that two pattern of @entity21 occur in the @entity18 model.\n", "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of intensive sleep retraining in comparison and combination with traditional behavioral intervention for chronic @entity22 . @entity1 : Seventy-nine volunteers with @entity22 (with or without sleep maintenance difficulties) were randomly assigned either to intensive sleep retraining (ISR), @entity23 ( @entity23 ), ISR plus @entity23 , or the control (sleep hygiene) treatment condition. INTERVENTION: ISR treatment consisted of 50 sleep onset trials over a 25-h sleep deprivation period. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Treatment response was assessed with sleep diary, activity monitoring, and questionnaire measures. The active treatment groups (ISR, @entity23 , ISR+ @entity23 ) all resulted in significant improvements in sleep onset latency and sleep efficiency, with moderate to large effect sizes from pre- to post-treatment. Wake time after sleep onset decreased significantly in the @entity23 and ISR+ @entity23 groups. Total sleep time increased significantly in the ISR and ISR+ @entity23 treatment groups. @entity1 receiving ISR (ISR, ISR+ @entity23 ) experienced rapidly improved SOL and @entity24 during treatment, suggesting an advantage of rapid improvements in sleep in response to ISR. Although there were few statistically significant differences between groups on individual variables, ISR+ @entity23 resulted in consistently larger effect sizes of change than other treatments, including questionnaire measures of @entity25 , sleep self-efficacy, and daytime functioning. The combination treatment group (ISR+ @entity23 ) showed trends to outperform other active treatment groups with fewer treatment dropouts, and a greater proportion of treatment responders with 61% reaching \" @entity25 \" status. Treatment gains achieved at post-treatment in the active treatment groups were largely maintained throughout follow-up periods to 6 months. CONCLUSION: This 25-hour intensive conditioning treatment for @entity22 can produce rapid improvements in sleep, daytime functioning, and psychological variables. Adding ISR to traditional interventions seems to result in a superior treatment response.\n"], "titles": ["Attributes of brain metastases from XXXX .\n", "Changes of serum XXXX concentration after
